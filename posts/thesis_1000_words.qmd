Take a deep breath
======

Writing a thesis can feel overwhelming at first, but it really doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re working on a BSc or MSc thesis, this process should be a rewarding and even enjoyable experience. If done right, it’s one of the few moments in your studies where you get to really take the lead—asking a question you care about and seeing where it takes you.

Start with something that interests you. This sounds obvious, but it matters. When students are genuinely curious about their topic, the whole process works better. They read more deeply, write more thoughtfully, and engage with feedback more meaningfully. You don’t need a perfect question from the outset, especially at BSc level, but you do need a spark. Something you want to understand better.


The bigger picture
======

A good thesis is also one that’s feasible. Big, complex questions are appealing in theory, but they’re rarely manageable within the scope of a student project. The best work I’ve supervised often focuses on one method and one main idea, carried out with clarity and care. It’s better to do something simple well than to do something ambitious halfway.

At MSc level, more independence is expected from the start. Students are generally expected to arrive with a clear idea of their topic and to develop a more original contribution to the academic literature. That said, support is still there, and the same principles apply: clarity over complexity, structure over improvisation, and a well-reasoned approach to methods and writing.

For BSc students, the process is more structured. The work is often group-based, with staged assignments and regular feedback. This helps students stay on track and provides a useful framework for what, for many, is their first piece of independent research.

Regardless of level, writing is the central skill. A thesis lives and dies on how well it’s written. This doesn’t mean flowery language or complicated phrasing, it means clear, coherent thinking on the page. Readers shouldn’t have to guess what you mean or how your argument fits together. Every section should do a job, and every paragraph should move the argument forward.


The section-specific details
======

The Abstract should summarise what you studied, how you studied it, and what you found: brief, factual, and to the point.

The Introduction needs to make the case for your research: why the topic matters, what the main question is, how you approach it, and how it contributes to the broader literature.

The Theoretical Framework should not just list what others have said, but explain how you’re thinking about the topic and what concepts or hypotheses guide your analysis.

The Data and Methods section explains what materials you used and how you analysed them. This should be clear enough that someone else could, in theory, replicate what you did independently.

The Results section should present your findings clearly and systematically, without overloading the reader; if you include a Discussion here, use it to interpret what those findings mean in light of your research question and theory.

The Conclusion ties everything together: what you found, why it matters, what the limitations were, and where the research could go next.

Formatting, structure, and references matter too, but the real foundation is clarity—of thought, of question, of execution.


Ownership and Expectations
======

Above all, take ownership of your work. Supervisors are there to help, but they won’t, and can’t, catch everything. The best students use feedback wisely, plan their time well, and take responsibility for shaping their project. This is your research, and the final thesis should reflect how you think, not just what you did.

Writing a thesis isn’t just about ticking boxes: it’s about learning how to ask better questions, how to test ideas, and how to communicate your findings. It’s a challenge, yes, but also a rare opportunity. With the right focus and a bit of care, it can be a genuinely rewarding part of your academic life.
