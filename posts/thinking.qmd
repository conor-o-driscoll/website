Statistics As A Way Of Seeing
======

Every social and spatial scientist works with two worlds at once. There is the world we can see; that is, the concrete stuff of daily life: housing prices, bus schedules, job changes, school applications. Then there is the world we infer: the processes we believe are shaping all that surface activity: inequality, migration, gentrification, opportunity, discrimination, efficiency.

Statistics sits right at that intersection. It is not just a set of techniques for crunching numbers. It is a disciplined way of making sense of experience, especially in messy, complex social settings. 

But if you’ve ever opened a statistics textbook and felt like it was solving problems you don’t have, or skipping the ones you care about, you’re not alone. Too often, stats is introduced through dry definitions and unfamiliar jargon, rather than through the questions that drive social inquiry.

So this first post is not about p-values or confidence intervals. It is about what it means to reason statistically; to adopt a particular way of seeing the world that is especially suited to the challenges of the social and spatial sciences: uncertainty, complexity, partial knowledge, and competing explanations.


Statistics Is About Asking [Better] Questions
======

The kind of thinking involved in Statistics may seem quite different from what you are used to. But once we strip away all the jargon and really examine what it is _precisely_ we are doing, you will quickly realise that the kind of thinking involved in statistics is not entirely new to you. In fact, many of your day-to-day assumptions and decisions already depend on statistical thinking.

Suppose I tell you that I have two friends: one is around six feet tall and the other is five feet tall. What would be your best guess as to each one's sex? 

Of course, you have not seen all men, or all women, but experience probably tells you that by-and-large, men tend to be taller than women. 

Therefore, I expect that you feel fairly confident in assuming that my smaller friend is female, while my taller friend is male. In other words, in the _absence of any other information_, you probably think it's more likely that a tall adult is male and a small adult is female.

We do this all the time. When you say: "On average, I cycle 50km per week", or "We can expect a lot of rain at this time of year", or "It is more likely that you will do well in your exams if you begin studying early" you are making statistical statements even though you have performed no calculations. Indeed, each of these examples is showing off one particular type of statistical thinking; answer the questions below to figure out which.

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}

What type of statistical thinking best corresponds to each of the following scenarios:

1. On average, I cycle 50km per week. `r mcq(c("Generalizing", "Predicting", answer = "Summarizing", "Assessing"))`

2. We can expect a lot of rain at this time of year. `r mcq(c(answer = "Generalizing", "Predicting", "Assessing", "Summarizing"))`

3. It is more likely that you will do well in your exams if you begin studying early. `r mcq(c("Assessing", answer = "Predicting", "Generalizing", "Summarizing"))`

:::

When we summarize our past experience in a rough-and-ready way, or generalize from previous experiences, and use this information to make predictions about what we expect, we are subconsciously making broader sense of our lived experiences. That is why thinking statistically is not about chasing certainty, it is about navigating ambiguity with discipline. We use data to challenge our assumptions, to explore patterns we might not otherwise see, and to resist being misled by what seems obvious.


Becoming The Right Kind of Skeptic
======

When people think about statistics, they often think about numbers. Because they are numbers, people thus tend to think that statistics are cold, hard facts that have been bestowed upon us by nature. But statistics are human-made. People choose what to count, how to count it, and how to frame the result. That means statistics are not just facts, they are interpretations.

To think statistically, then, is to think critically. It is about learning to ask: Is that plausible? Compared to what? How do they know that? These habits of mind matter, especially in a world full of misleading headlines and dodgy comparisons.

The more you practice statistics as a mindset, the more these habits become second nature; a kind of internal skepticism paired with external curiosity.

::: callout-note
Today, information is available nearly instantaneously, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell what is true and what is not. Even though misinformation has been a problem that has existed since ancient Greece, the unique problem we face today is that it has proliferated and is closely intertwined on the internet with real information, making it sometimes difficult to identify. 

Some of you who might respond by saying "it is not my job to evaluate statistics critically". I say that it may not be your job, but it is your responsibility to own your opinions. Taking ownership of these opinions requires you to think critically about the words and numbers you encounter, and scrutinize/examine them as best you can.
:::

Test your intuition using the following examples, where `TRUE` = Plausible and `False` = Not Plausible:

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}

4. A crystal wine glass fell off a table onto a thick carpet without breaking. `r torf(TRUE)`

5. A crystal wine glass fell off the roof of a forty-storey skyscraper onto the footpath without breaking. `r torf(FALSE)`

6. The best salesperson in Company X makes 1,000 sales every day. `r torf(FALSE)`

7. The cost of a telephone has decreased by 12,000% since the formation of the Communication Satellite Corportation. `r torf(FALSE)`

:::

Problems 4 and 5 were hopefully easy for most of you. Problem 6 is a bit trickier because it is not immediately obvious where to begin. Assuming that it takes: i) five seconds to dial a phone number, ii) another five seconds for the phone to ring, iii) 10 seconds to deliver your sales pitch, and iv) 40 seconds to collect the buyers bank details and address. That adds up to one call per minute. Finally, lets assume that every phone call ends in a sale. Even under these highly optimistic conditions, you come out sixty sales per hour, and 480 sales in an eight hour work day with no breaks. Need I say any more?

Claim 7 is difficult to verify if you do not spot the immediate contradiction. If a cost decreases by 100 percent it means that, irrespective of the starting price, the price is now zero. If a cost decreases by 200 percent, it means that someone is paying _you_ the same amount of money that you used to pay them for their product. Thus, while a decrease in price of 100% is quite rare, a decrease of 12000% seems wildly unlikely. You might think this is obvious. Tell that to the editors of _Science_ (a leading scientific journal) who [published](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.223.4636.553) such a statement.

The fact that claim 7 is expressed as a percentage introduces further complexity. Percentages seem so simple and incorruptable, but they are often confusing. For example, if your salary drops by 50% tomorrow, you will not "break-even" by increasing your new salary by 50% because the baselines have changed.

::: callout-note

If you were recieving €1,000 each week and that suddenly dropped to €500 (a 50% reduction), a 50% increase on that pay only brings you to €750.

:::

Similarly, if interest rates rise from 3 to 4 percent, that constitutes an increase of one percentage point, or an increase of 33 percent. Meanwhile, if interest rates drop from 4 to 3 percent, that constitutes a decrease of one percentage point, but a decrease of 25 percent. Has your head exploded yet?


Work A Bit Harder At Thinking Critically
======

In another somewhat famous case, the state of New Jersey adopted legislation that denied additional benefits to mothers who have children while already on welfare. Some legislators believed that women were having babies in New Jersey simply to increase the amount on their welfare checks. Within two months, legislators were declaring that the "family cap" law was a success because *births* had already fallen by 16 percent, as reported in the [_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/us/welfare-in-transition-new-jersey-the-gop-s-family-cap-has-a-democratic-history.html). Now, maybe things are different in New Jersey, but I believe that it takes nine months for a pregnancy to come to term, so how can this effect possibly be attributed to the policy?

Other claims, like *More people have cell phones than toilets* (reported by [_Time_ Magazine](https://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/25/more-people-have-cell-phones-than-toilets-u-n-study-shows/) in 2013) are a bit trickier because the answer depends on a host of factors, like who/how we count and what we compare. One potentially reasonable place to start might be the observation that many people in the developing world do not have indoor plumbing, whereas many people in the developed world have more than one cell phone. From this angle, the claim seems plausible. This is not to say that we should accept it, but rather that we cannot reject it out-of-hand as being ridiculous. In this case, what matters isn’t whether you instantly know the answer, but whether you know how to start thinking about it.

Sometimes you cannot always determine whether a statistic or claim is reliable. Sure, the people who generate and report on such statistics should do this for you, but they often do not. Sometimes, this is deliberate (i.e., politically-motivated) but other times the people generating/reporting on these statistics do not understand them all that well. That is how runaway statistics take hold, potentially poisoning public opinion and discourse on a particular topic.

Take the widely reported statistic (from some years ago) that, in the U.S. 150,000 girls and young women die of annorexia each year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the annual number of deaths from _all causes_ for girls and women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four (a reasonable definition for "girls and young women"?) is around 8,500. If you become more conservative in your definitions and incorporate women aged twnety-five to fourty-four, you still only get 55,000. It should be obvious that annorexia deaths in one year cannot be three times the number of all reported deaths.

Statistical thinking begins not with formulas, but with noticing. Noticing change. Noticing contrast. Noticing when something feels off. You do not need advanced math to do this. You need curiosity, a willingness to slow down, and a readiness to challenge your first impression.


Wrapping Up
======

Statistics is not just about techniques. It is about developing better instincts and organising your curiosity. It helps you ask clearer questions and give more careful answers.

It will not turn you into a calculator. But it will help you see more clearly. To doubt usefully, not cynically. To ask things like: Where did that number come from? What is the comparison? What is the alternative?

If you have ever had a hunch something was not quite right, or spotted a pattern in your surroundings, congratulations. You have already started thinking statistically.
