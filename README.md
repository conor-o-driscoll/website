#Last Updated: 13-06-2025


#TO-DO list:

[1] Generate CSS file so that fonts and aesthetics can better match what I am aiming for;

[2] Explore templates for news and musings sections

[3] Potentially integrate animation blocks into "talks" subsection

[4] Why does CV icon fail to render but the CV hyperlink works fine

[5] Why does the website hyperlink in my CV fail to update on the website even though it is up to date in the file?
