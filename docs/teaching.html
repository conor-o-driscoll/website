<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-geography-msc">Economic Geography (MSc)</h3>
<p>This course examines how global trends—such as technological change, climate change, and demographic transitions—affect regions differently, leading to varying economic, social, and environmental outcomes. It focuses on understanding the causes of regional socio-economic inequalities and explores how governments and other actors attempt to address them through policy at different spatial scales.</p>
<p>The course has two main aims. First, it introduces students to key theoretical and empirical debates in Economic Geography. Second, it applies these insights to real-world practices in local and regional development. Topics include regional labour markets, entrepreneurship, globalization, and spatial policy tools such as city branding, business incentives, and land-use planning.</p>
<p>Students explore both analytical concepts and empirical approaches, with a focus on the interaction between people, firms, policy, and place. The course highlights the role of institutions and governance structures in shaping regional outcomes, and discusses how development paths differ across city regions, intermediate areas, and rural zones.</p>
<p>A key feature of the course is its applied orientation. Students learn how academic insights relate to practical policy decisions, preparing them for careers in regional development. This includes a study trip to Brussels to engage with institutions involved in EU regional policy.</p>
<p>By the end of the course, students are able to analyse complex geographical patterns, understand the relationship between economic and spatial processes, and assess policy responses to regional challenges. They also gain awareness of relevant labour market opportunities and the professional context of economic geographers.</p>

<section id="introductory-statistics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introductory-statistics">Introductory Statistics</h4>
<p>These courses start with introductions to descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and probability. Much of this learning focuses on how these subjects relate to business practices. Students are introduced to elementary calculus, the mathematics of finance, differentiation, matrix algebra, alongside exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial functions. Students use this knowledge to calculate elasticities, solve for equilibria, and work with series and annuities.</p>
<p>From there, a major emphasis is placed on the practical application of statistics to business contexts. Teaching centres around the practicalities of working with data. Students are exposed to key software used for analysing economic and financial data, such as Excel and STATA. They are also tasked with collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting economic data in written reports. Supplementing this are introductions to the numerous types of economic and financial data available, and the outlets from which these data can be acquired.</p>

<p>These courses build upon introductory material by focusing on the interactions between producers and consumers within different types of markets. In particular, entrepreneurship, the competitive process and technological change, the determination of the relative prices of goods, and factors of production under various types of market structure are all covered.</p>
<p>These courses then pivot in three distinct directions to focus on the government, the firm, and labour market. We consider the role of government in achieving social goals and public policy objectives. Students examine how government actions impact resource allocation, income distribution, and overall welfare. For the firm, we focus on budgets, risk and uncertainty, revenue functions, alongside production and cost analysis. While in labour markets, we emphasize the factors driving labour supply and demand, the acquisition of training and skills, technology and decision making, alongside government intervention in such markets, such as through minimum wages and taxation.</p>
