    "title": "What Is Statistics?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Thinking Statistically: A Refresher\nOur ability to notice things, observe patterns, and make connections between people, places, and events is the foundation of our ability to think statistically. This kind of thinking may seem quite different from what you’re used to, especially if your only encounter with statistics has been through dense equations or dry lectures. But once we strip away the jargon and focus on what we’re actually doing, you’ll quickly see that this kind of reasoning is not new to you at all. The post XXX goes into more detail on this point.\nStatistical thinking is evidenced in many of our day-to-day observations, such as: “On average, I cycle 50km per week”, or “We can expect a lot of rain at this time of year”, or “It is more likely that you will do well in your exams if you begin studying early”. Each of these statements is statistical in nature, even though you haven’t performed any calculations. They all summarize past experience in a rough-and-ready way and use that summary to make a prediction or a generalization. They show how we move from anecdote to pattern, from individual experiences to broader claims.\nMoreover, many other types of day-to-day observations involve statistical thinking. Many involve counting and measuring (even though we would rarely say that we “quantify” stuff regularly). If you do not believe me, think for yourself how often your observations of the world concern questions like “How much?”, “How big?”, “How far?”, “How often?”, “How difficult?”, “How quickly?”, “How well?”. These are quantitative judgments, and they are everywhere.\n\n\nFrom Anecdote To Pattern\nWhen we look at a data point — a higher dropout rate, a cluster of job losses, a spike in rents — the statistical mindset does not just take it at face value. One of the great temptations in everyday life is to generalize from vivid examples. A bad experience with a GP becomes “the NHS is broken.” A few pricey listings on Paraius becomes “this city is unaffordable.” But if we want to understand the world at the level of systems, structures, or policies, we need more than stories. We need patterns.\nThat is where statistics comes in. We might think of it as the science of turning data into understanding because it gives us a language to talk about variation, uncertainty, and difference without relying solely on intuition or ideology. But the understanding it offers is always provisional. The numbers never speak for themselves. We interpret them, and those interpretations depend on the questions we ask and the data we have.\nRather than seeing statistics as a way to eliminate uncertainty, we should see it as a way to work productively within it.\n\n\nFrom Observation To Data\nSometimes, we observe a single thing — a person, a place, an event — and note several of its features. More interestingly, we often observe many things that are similar in some respects but quite different in others. We notice patterns across people, places, or time. We end up with a collection of observations, or, in the language of statistics, data.\nFaced with such a collection, it is natural to start comparing. What is the same? What is different? What might explain those differences? This is where statistical thinking deepens. The overarching question becomes: what can we learn from this data?\nStatistics helps us summarize what we have found so we can be clear about the facts. But it also helps us go further: to compare, to explain, and to predict. It reminds us to be cautious. What appears true in one context may not hold in another, as I am sure you are all acutely aware. If we want to generalize more confidently, the logical starting point is to gather more experience - that is, collect more data. This speaks to the fact that the more contexts, situations, and experiences we observe, the more confident we can be in drawing conclusions and making suggestions. In other words, if we want to generalize more confidently, we need more data, which happens to be the logic underpinning one of the most powerful ideas in statistics: the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n\nLikelihood, Not Certainty\nAt its core, statistical thinking is about likelihood, not certainty. We weigh the chances (i.e., probability). We expect patterns to hold “in general” or “on average” or “in the long run,” not in every case. That is why statistics matters so much for the social and spatial sciences. People and societies are complex, varied, and hard to predict. But with good data and careful reasoning, we can still learn a lot.\nTwo central goals of statistics are:\n[1] summarizing what we found out so that we, and others, can be clear about what the facts are.\n[2] using the summary to make comparisons with what is known of other situations, or predictions about what may turn out to be true in situations elsewhere or in the future.\nThese goals might sound soft, even vague. But they are the foundation of all statistical work. Before we can test a hypothesis or quantify uncertainty, we need to know what matters, what varies, and what might be related. This requires a theoretical understanding of the problem you are studying just as much as it requires an understanding of what is happening in your data.\nIn that sense, statistics does not replace your instincts. It organizes and strengthens them. You already ask whether something seems off. You already notice patterns. What statistics offers is a way to build on those instincts: to sharpen them, test them, and sometimes correct them. It helps you become more precise in your questions and more careful in your answers. And that is a powerful skill, no matter what field you are in.\n\n\nWhat Is Statistics?\nStatistics is a word that causes confusion, not because it is complicated, but because it has so many meanings. It can refer to a subject of study, to methods of analysing data, to the data themselves, or to the specific numbers we calculate. For example, a researcher might study statistics, use statistics to analyse data, interpret official statistics, and report a statistic like the average income.\nStatistics is everywhere — in the news, in sports, in science, in policy, in marketing, in medicine. But it also suffers from deep misconceptions. Many see it as dry, overly technical, or even manipulative. Some fear it as a mathematical jungle. Others distrust it because they have seen how numbers can be twisted to support a narrative. But the problem is not usually the statistics, it is how they are used, what is being measured, and what those measures really mean.\nIn fact, the modern world of statistics is less about arithmetic and more about reasoning, exploration, and interpretation. The computer has largely taken over the calculations. What matters now is clarity of thought: asking good questions, interpreting results wisely, and making sense of the data we have.\nYou might think of statistics as the technology of extracting meaning from data. Or the technology of handling uncertainty. Or the discipline of making inferences from the unknown. All of these get at the same core idea: statistics is how we learn from evidence.\nStatistics arises out of caution. We know our observations of the world are imperfect. But rather than ignore this, statistics embraces it. It gives us tools to measure and reason through uncertainty; to weigh possibilities, to understand variation, and to gauge how far wrong we might be. It is one of the only disciplines that directly tackles the problem of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is why statistics and data are so tightly linked. Data — often numbers, but not always — give us a way to represent the world. These representations are never perfect, but they are often good enough to work with. Of course, poor data leads to poor conclusions. The rise of big data and advanced tools has not changed that. As ever, good judgement matters.\n\n\nIt is no surprise then that statistics attracts suspicion. Part of it is statistics anxiety — a common experience among students. But it is also a deeper cultural mistrust: of numbers used to persuade, distract, or deceive. And sometimes, rightly so. We have all seen statistics used selectively, or turned into targets that then get gamed (as with Goodhart’s Law). But again, the fault lies not in the numbers themselves, rather, in how they are chosen, interpreted, and applied.\nThat is why good statistical thinking matters. It helps us ask better questions, use better methods, and interpret results more responsibly. It reminds us that statistics is not a silver bullet — it is a way of seeing. And used well, it can guide us through uncertainty, reveal hidden patterns, and sharpen our understanding of the world.\nAnd if that sounds useful, that is because it is.\n\n\nBibliography\n\nStatistics: A Very Short Introduction by David J.

    "title": "Start Young, Drive Less: The Overlooked Power of the School-Run",
    "section": "",
    "text": "School-runs are a common but underexamined part of daily mobility. In Ireland, they account for nearly one in five household trips, yet they’re often treated as an extension of the adult commute or folded into broader discussions about household logistics. Our recent study aimed to take the school-run seriously; not just as a variant of commuting, but as a travel behaviour shaped by a distinct set of social, spatial, and infrastructural dynamics.\nDrawing on census data from almost 300,000 secondary school students across Ireland, we linked individual travel behaviour to a range of built environment characteristics. We used Generalised Structural Equation Modelling (GSEM) to capture the direct and indirect relationships between factors like land-use mix, transport infrastructure, household structure, and mode choice. This approach allowed us to unpack how both context and constraint shape how students get to school.\n\nSchool-Runs Are Not Just Commutes with Backpacks\nIn some respects, school-runs mirror adult commuting: students are more likely to walk, cycle, or take public transport when they live closer to school, in more compact neighbourhoods, and in areas with better infrastructure. These patterns align closely with findings from commuting research.\nBut school-runs also reflect the complexity of family routines. Even for secondary students, decisions about how to get to school are influenced by household structures, parental schedules, perceptions of safety, and the presence of siblings. Car-based trip-chaining is common, and family habits around transport tend to carry over across generations.\nRecognising these dynamics helps us move beyond individual preferences and towards a better understanding of the constraints and contexts that shape school travel.\n\n\nWhat We Found\nOur findings can be summarised around three key insights:\nBuilt environment matters. Students living in more mixed-use, compact areas with better walking and transit infrastructure are significantly more likely to use sustainable modes. These effects hold even when we account for household income and other socioeconomic factors.\nDistance remains the strongest determinant. Longer school trips are strongly associated with car use. Students who live and study in the same neighbourhood, especially within the same Electoral Division — are much more likely to walk or take public transport. Travel distance continues to shape the choice set in powerful ways.\nHousehold context matters. Students from more affluent and two-parent households are more likely to be driven to school. While these households may live in areas with good infrastructure, access to a private vehicle seems to override other factors, highlighting the role of habit, convenience, and household coordination.\nWe also found that the structure of the local transport network plays a key role. Areas with denser road networks tended to see higher rates of car use, while greater availability of walking and cycling infrastructure was associated with more active travel. In short, people tend to use the infrastructure that’s available to them.\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nThere is growing policy interest in promoting active travel and reducing car dependency for health, environmental, and congestion reasons. But most interventions still focus on adult commuters. The school-run, by contrast, offers a more consistent and replicable point of intervention. It happens daily, follows predictable routes, and shapes the travel habits of young people.\nWhile behaviour change campaigns are important, our findings suggest that structural conditions, particularly built form, infrastructure quality, and travel distance, remain central to shifting how people move. If we want to support more sustainable school travel, we need to plan for it: shorten distances between home and school, build coherent and safe active travel networks, and improve the quality and reliability of public transport.\nUltimately, school-runs are not just about getting from A to B. They reflect broader spatial, social, and institutional dynamics. Understanding them better can help us build cities that support more inclusive and sustainable forms of everyday mobility.\nFor the full technical details, please check out the full paper here!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Take a deep breath\nWriting a thesis can feel overwhelming at first, but it really doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re working on a BSc or MSc thesis, this process should be a rewarding and even enjoyable experience. If done right, it’s one of the few moments in your studies where you get to really take the lead—asking a question you care about and seeing where it takes you.\nStart with something that interests you. This sounds obvious, but it matters. When students are genuinely curious about their topic, the whole process works better. They read more deeply, write more thoughtfully, and engage with feedback more meaningfully. You don’t need a perfect question from the outset, especially at BSc level, but you do need a spark. Something you want to understand better.\n\n\nThe bigger picture\nA good thesis is also one that’s feasible. Big, complex questions are appealing in theory, but they’re rarely manageable within the scope of a student project. The best work I’ve supervised often focuses on one method and one main idea, carried out with clarity and care. It’s better to do something simple well than to do something ambitious halfway.\nAt MSc level, more independence is expected from the start. Students are generally expected to arrive with a clear idea of their topic and to develop a more original contribution to the academic literature. That said, support is still there, and the same principles apply: clarity over complexity, structure over improvisation, and a well-reasoned approach to methods and writing.\nFor BSc students, the process is more structured. The work is often group-based, with staged assignments and regular feedback. This helps students stay on track and provides a useful framework for what, for many, is their first piece of independent research.\nRegardless of level, writing is the central skill. A thesis lives and dies on how well it’s written. This doesn’t mean flowery language or complicated phrasing, it means clear, coherent thinking on the page. Readers shouldn’t have to guess what you mean or how your argument fits together. Every section should do a job, and every paragraph should move the argument forward.\n\n\nThe section-specific details\nThe Abstract should summarise what you studied, how you studied it, and what you found: brief, factual, and to the point.\nThe Introduction needs to make the case for your research: why the topic matters, what the main question is, how you approach it, and how it contributes to the broader literature.\nThe Theoretical Framework should not just list what others have said, but explain how you’re thinking about the topic and what concepts or hypotheses guide your analysis.\nThe Data and Methods section explains what materials you used and how you analysed them. This should be clear enough that someone else could, in theory, replicate what you did independently.\nThe Results section should present your findings clearly and systematically, without overloading the reader; if you include a Discussion here, use it to interpret what those findings mean in light of your research question and theory.\nThe Conclusion ties everything together: what you found, why it matters, what the limitations were, and where the research could go next.\nFormatting, structure, and references matter too, but the real foundation is clarity—of thought, of question, of execution.\n\n\nOwnership and Expectations\nAbove all, take ownership of your work. Supervisors are there to help, but they won’t, and can’t, catch everything. The best students use feedback wisely, plan their time well, and take responsibility for shaping their project. This is your research, and the final thesis should reflect how you think, not just what you did.\nWriting a thesis isn’t just about ticking boxes: it’s about learning how to ask better questions, how to test ideas, and how to communicate your findings. It’s a challenge, yes, but also a rare opportunity. With the right focus and a bit of care, it can be a genuinely rewarding part of your academic life.\n\n\nLooking for more?\nIf you found this post useful, I suggest you check out the fully-fleshed out writing guide that I distribute to all the students under my supervision. You can find it here."

    "text": "University of Groningen\n\n\n\nEconomic Geography (MSc)\n\nThis course (GEMEGTT) examines how global trends—such as technological change, climate change, and demographic transitions—affect regions differently, leading to varying economic, social, and environmental outcomes. It focuses on understanding the causes of regional socio-economic inequalities and explores how governments and other actors attempt to address them through policy at different spatial scales.\nThe course has two main aims. First, it introduces students to key theoretical and empirical debates in Economic Geography. Second, it applies these insights to real-world practices in local and regional development. Topics include regional labour markets, entrepreneurship, globalization, and spatial policy tools such as city branding, business incentives, and land-use planning.\nStudents explore both analytical concepts and empirical approaches, with a focus on the interaction between people, firms, policy, and place. The course highlights the role of institutions and governance structures in shaping regional outcomes, and discusses how development paths differ across city regions, intermediate areas, and rural zones.\nA key feature of the course is its applied orientation. Students learn how academic insights relate to practical policy decisions, preparing them for careers in regional development. This includes a study trip to Brussels to engage with institutions involved in EU regional policy.\nBy the end of the course, students are able to analyse complex geographical patterns, understand the relationship between economic and spatial processes, and assess policy responses to regional challenges. They also gain awareness of relevant labour market opportunities and the professional context of economic geographers.\n\n\nRecommended Readings\n\n\nLocal and Regional Development, by Andy Pike, Andrés Rodríguez-Pose, and John Tomaney\nAn Introduction To Geographical and Urban Economics: A Spiky World, by Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk\nThe New Geography of Jobs, by Enrico Moretti\nTriumph of The City: How Urban Spaces Make Us Human, by Edward Glaeser\nThe Death and Life of Great American Cities, by Jane Jacobs\nOrder Without Design: How Markets Shape Cities, by Alain Bertaud\nGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, by Jared Diamond\nThe Wealth of Cities and The Poverty of Nations, by Christof Parnreiter\nThe Great Convergence: Information Technology and The New Globalisation, by Richard Baldwin\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics and Quantitative Research Methods (BSc)\n\nThis covers a trilogy of Introduction, Intermediate, and Applied Statistics courses which I currently teach at the University of Groningen.

Much of this learning focuses on how these subjects relate to business practices. Students are introduced to elementary calculus, the mathematics of finance, differentiation, matrix algebra, alongside exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial functions. Students use this knowledge to calculate elasticities, solve for equilibria, and work with series and annuities.\nFrom there, a major emphasis is placed on the practical application of statistics to business contexts. Teaching centres around the practicalities of working with data. Students are exposed to key software used for analysing economic and financial data, such as Excel and STATA. They are also tasked with collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting economic data in written reports. Supplementing this are introductions to the numerous types of economic and financial data available, and the outlets from which these data can be acquired.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1111 (Economic Data Collection) EC1200 (Quantitative Techniques For Economics 1) EC1209 (Understanding and Interpreting Data) MA1100 (Introductory Mathematics For Business)\n\n\nRecommended Readings\n\n\nStatistics: A Very Short Introduction by David J.

Students learn to work with theories of supply and demand, fiscal and monetary policy, international trade, and exchange rates, while also covering national income accounting, the measurement of economic activity, and the circular flow of income.\nThe role of government in influencing economic outcomes is also explored. Topics such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the role of central banks are discussed, along with the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing macroeconomic policies. This provides students with opportunities to apply theoretical concepts to analyze current economic events and policy debates, enhancing their critical thinking and analytical skills.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1116 (Introductory Macroeconomics) EC1208 (Principles of the Macro Economy) EC1503 (Economic Analysis for Food Business) EC1122 (Markets, Governments and the Economics of Social Issues)\n\n\nRecommended Readings\n\n\nThe Great Economists: How Their Ideas Can Help Us Today, by Linda Yueh\nHow To Think Like An Economist, by Robbie Mochrie.\nCan’t We Just Print More Money?

Themes and topics studied include human capital, inequality, money and monetary policy, alongside national and international economic variables which affect business performance.\nSome of these courses then pivot to focus on social issues and policy, thereby requiring detailed analysis of issues like healthcare, pensions, and the welfare state, while some of these courses focus on financial markets. An overarching theme in these courses, however, is the role of governmental intervention in the economy alongside how Ireland is situated in the global macroeconomic environment.

We consider the role of government in achieving social goals and public policy objectives. Students examine how government actions impact resource allocation, income distribution, and overall welfare. For the firm, we focus on budgets, risk and uncertainty, revenue functions, alongside production and cost analysis. While in labour markets, we emphasize the factors driving labour supply and demand, the acquisition of training and skills, technology and decision making, alongside government intervention in such markets, such as through minimum wages and taxation.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1121 (Markets, Governments, and The Economics of Social Issues) EC2200 (Economics of Managerial Decision Making) EC3127 (Economics of The Labour Market) EC4211 (Economics of The Labour Market)\n\n\nRecommended Readings\n\n\nThe Great Economists: How Their Ideas Can Help Us Today, by Linda Yueh.\nHow To Think Like An Economist, by Robbie Mochrie.\nFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side of Everything, by Steven D.

The topics I am interested in broadly fall under the umbrella subjects of Urban Studies, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Economic Geography, and Transportation. If the core focus of a given project falls within the remit of any of these subjects, then chances are that I will be interested in supervising it. One thing that I am passionate about is writing, and ensuring that students produce a high-quality written product which is among the top priorities for me when I supervise independent research projects.\nTo help students along in this journey, I have created a writing guide which provides a broad scaffold students can use when learning how to write effectively. You can access this guide here.\nIf you are a student and especially interested in working on a specific topic under my direct supervision, please email me at c [dot] odriscoll [at] rug [dot] nl\n\n\n\nBSc Research Project Supervision\n\nAt the University of Groningen, I am heavily involved in the supervision of BSc theses. Usually, I take two groups of students: one per semester. When I supervise these groups on my own, my theme of choice is Cities.\nI’m drawn to the subject of cities because they illuminate how human potential is concentrated, expressed, and contested in space. For much of history, cities have been foundational to economic growth, innovation, and social change. Their dense networks of people, ideas, and resources create agglomeration effects that not only boost productivity but also shape everyday life and long-term regional prosperity. Cities are not just economic engines—they are complex living systems where geography, economics, planning, and sociology converge, offering a lens into the structures and dynamics that define the modern world.\nWhat fascinates me is this dual nature: cities are sites of opportunity and dynamism, but also of tension and inequality. The very features that make urban areas productive—density, connectivity, diversity—also generate challenges like housing shortages, congestion, environmental degradation, and social fragmentation. As urbanisation accelerates and the spatial distribution of economic activity becomes increasingly uneven, cities expose and amplify regional disparities, while also being on the front lines of global risks such as climate change, public health crises, and economic shocks.\nStudying cities, for me, is a way to understand how spatial processes shape economic and social outcomes, how individual and collective decisions are mediated by place, and how policy can engage with these dynamics to foster more equitable and resilient futures. Cities aren’t just where things happen—they are how things happen.\nWithin this group, I place no hard restrictions on the type of questions students can tackle, so long as those questions are intricately linked to cities. Given my background, I like to stress that the broad subjects students should focus on within this theme include Urban Studies, Urban Economics, Economic Geography, Regional Science, and Transportation\nSometimes, I share group supervision duties. In this context, the theme can change to suit the expertise of the person I am working with. I have listed some of these themes below:\n\nTo Be Added.\nTo Be Added.\n\n\n\n\nMSc Thesis Supervision\n\nAt the University of Groningen, I am heavily involved in the supervision of MSc thesis students in the Economic Geography and Real Estate Studies programme. Much like my philosophy for supervising BSc students, I tend to cast a wide net topic-wise, and encourage any quantitatively-oriented student to reach out if they have a cool idea they would like to explore which falls under the broad remit of Urban Studies, Urban Economics, Economic Geography, Regional Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n\nPhD Thesis Supervision\n\nI have no formal experience supervising PhD students, yet. Watch this space as in the coming months this will change."

    "title": "What is the cost of commuting?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s well known that where you live influences how you travel. A recent study, co-authored with Dr. Kevin Credit takes a different approach by exploring how where you live impacts the cost of travelling. More specifically, we look at how different types of built environments shape the costs of using particulary modes of transport, and the costs of travelling along specific routes, when commuting in the Dublin metropolitan area.\n\nUnderstanding Travel Costs\nAt the heart of our study is the concept of mobility costs—a way of capturing how much effort, time, and inconvenience it takes to commute using different modes of transport. These costs aren’t just financial; they reflect how infrastructure, congestion, and land-use patterns shape the real-world effectiveness of getting from A to B. Rather than looking only at which transport modes people choose, we focus on how cost-effective those modes are in different local environments. Using a “cost-distance” approach, we estimate the relative efficiency of car travel, walking, cycling, and public transport across the Dublin region. This allows us to uncover how built environments influence travel indirectly, by making certain modes more or less viable in different areas.\nDrawing on 2016 Census data and sources like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and the Irish Revenue Commissioners, we link commuter flows to detailed transport networks. We then use random forest models, a type of machine learning, to uncover how local environments shape mobility costs—often in complex, non-linear ways.\n\n\nWhat we found\nActive travel (walking and cycling) is most cost-effective in central Dublin and denser, walkable areas—but this benefit fades in overly dense or congested areas. We link this to the fact that these characteristics, while initially beneficial, can eventually lead to overcrowded streets, longer wait times at crossings, and more frequent stops. In these settings, travelling on foot or by bike may become stressful, when compared to other modes.\nSurprisingly, public transport is also quite inefficient in very dense areas. One might expect that higher density would support better service, shorter wait times, and greater usage. However, we suspect this result emerges because, in Ireland, road space is shared between cars and buses. The result? Cars and buses get stuck in the same traffic, making the trade-off between cars and public transport one which revolves around convenience and reliability—trade-offs cars win every time given the lack of countervailing measures (e.g., congestion pricing) in Irish city centres.\nThese patterns highlight how urban form and infrastructure design shape the real cost of commuting—not just in money, but in time, effort, and convenience.\n\n\nWhy this matters\nIf cities want to encourage sustainable travel, they need to reduce the relative cost of walking, cycling, and public transport. That means investing in segregated infrastructure, like bus and bike lanes that bypass congestion. But it also means designing coherent, connected transport networks, and thus directly influencing the viability of different transport modes across the urban-rural continuum.\nOne key observation we make is that Dublin’s public transport and cycling networks may be lagging behind those of global cities. For public transport, this observation stems from the lack of segregated transport infrastructure, while for active transport, it stems from the fragmentation of networks.\nProjects like BusConnects are steps in the right direction. But unless they’re supported by smart land-use planning that curbs sprawl, their impact will be limited. Simply put: we can’t build our way out of car dependence without also re-shaping the environments people move through.\nFor policymakers and urban designers, the message is clear: making sustainable travel easier isn’t just about offering alternatives: it’s about making those alternatives cost-effective, reliable, and competitive with the car.\nFor the full technical details, please refer to the full paper."

    "title": "Always visualise your data: Simpsons Paradox in action",
    "section": "",
    "text": "If you’ve ever opened a dataset and jumped straight into statistical testing, you’re not alone. It’s tempting to rush toward a result — an effect, a relationship, a difference — and get to work writing it up. But what if the “result” you find hides a deeper contradiction? What if the truth is visible in your data, but only if you look at it the right way?\nThis is where data visualization comes in. Visualization is how we make our data legible not just to others, but to ourselves. Indeed, I would make the case that you cannot fully understand what is going on in your data without some form of data visualisation as it helps us detect patterns, check assumptions, and avoid being misled.\nTo illustrate this, let’s explore one of the most famous cases where misleading aggregate data can lead to erroneous conclusions: Simpson’s Paradox, using the classic UC Berkeley admissions dataset from 1973.\n\nSetting The Scene\nImagine that you’re interested in studying gender bias in university admissions. You obtain real administrative data from UC Berkeley’s graduate programs from 1973 and start with what seems like a straightforward question:\nWere men more likely to be admitted than women?\nYou begin by exploring what type of data you have available in your dataset.\nIn this post, we will use the UCBAdmissions dataset: A well-known built-in R dataset derived from real administrative records of graduate admissions at UC Berkeley in 1973.\n\n#The relevant packages have been loaded elsewhere\n\n#Load the data\ndata(UCBAdmissions)\nucb_df &lt;- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)\n\n#What are the variable names?\nnames(ucb_df)\n\n[1] \"Admit\"  \"Gender\" \"Dept\"   \"Freq\"  \n\n#A broad overview of the structure these variables take\nglimpse(ucb_df)\n\nRows: 24\nColumns: 4\n$ Admit  &lt;fct&gt; Admitted, Rejected, Admitted, Rejected, Admitted, Rejected, Adm…\n$ Gender &lt;fct&gt; Male, Male, Female, Female, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male, M…\n$ Dept   &lt;fct&gt; A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, C, C, C, C, D, D, D, D, E, E, E, E, F, …\n$ Freq   &lt;dbl&gt; 512, 313, 89, 19, 353, 207, 17, 8, 120, 205, 202, 391, 138, 279…\n\n\nOk. These commands already tells us a lot about the structure of the dataset. There are four variables (columns) and 24 unique data points (rows). More specifically, we can see that it counts the number of applications for six departments by admissions status and sex. To really ensure that you understand the structure of this dataset, try answering the following questions:\n\n\nWhat type of variable is Admit? RatioIntervalBinaryNominalOrdinal\nWhat type of variable is Gender? RatioIntervalNominalOrdinal\nWhat type of variable is Freq? RatioIntervalBinaryNominalOrdinal\nWhat type of variable is Dept? RatioIntervalBinaryNominalOrdinal\nWhat type of variable is labelled as fct? BinaryNominalOrdinalAll of these\nWhat type of variable is labelled as dbl? IntervalRatioBoth of these\n\n\n\n\nAggregate Trends: A Broad Overview\nNow that we know how our dataset is structured and broadly what the variables look like, we can revisit our main research question: Were men more likely to be admitted than women?\nHow might we begin answering such a question? A logical first step might be to summarize overall admission rates by sex:\n\n#Calculate overall admission rates by gender\noverall_admit &lt;- ucb_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Admit) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Freq = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Admit, \n                     values_from = Freq) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total = Admitted + Rejected,\n         AdmitRate = Admitted / Total) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Gender'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n#Display the table\nprint(overall_admit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  Gender Admitted Rejected Total AdmitRate\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Male       1198     1493  2691     0.445\n2 Female      557     1278  1835     0.304\n\n\nTo ensure that you understand what this code is doing, try answering the following questions:\n\n\nTrue or False: Grouping by Gender and Admit allows us to generate seperate counts of admissions and rejections by Gender and Department. TRUEFALSE\nTrue or False: Grouping by Admit is unnecessary to generate the values used to compute AdmitRate. TRUEFALSE\nIf we wanted to make this table more professional in its presentation, which of the following packages might we use? ggplot2tidyversekableExtrastargazer\nWhich type of table does this example most closely resemble? summary statistics tablecrosstablefrequency table\n\n\nAt first glance, the results seem clear: men are more likely to be admitted to graduate school in UC Berkeley than woman.\n\n\nWhich column do we use to come to this conclusion? GenderAdmittedRejectedTotalAdmitRate\n\n\n\n\nDigging A Bit Deeper: Department-Specific Heterogeneity?\nYou might stop here and think your work is done. But this only tells us what is going on in the aggregate. Unless you are a macroeconomist, you should know better than to trust aggregate data; something interesting probably lies beneath the surface. So, with this in mind, we shall dig a bit deeper.\nLet’s start by breaking this down by department. The data includes six departments, labeled A–F. What happens when we examine admission rates within departments?\n\ndept_admit &lt;- ucb_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Dept, Gender, Admit) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Freq = sum(Freq)) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Admit, \n                     values_from = Freq) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total = Admitted + Rejected,\n         AdmitRate = Admitted / Total)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Dept', 'Gender'. You can override using\nthe `.groups` argument.\n\nprint(dept_admit)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 6\n# Groups:   Dept, Gender [12]\n   Dept  Gender Admitted Rejected Total AdmitRate\n   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A     Male        512      313   825    0.621 \n 2 A     Female       89       19   108    0.824 \n 3 B     Male        353      207   560    0.630 \n 4 B     Female       17        8    25    0.68  \n 5 C     Male        120      205   325    0.369 \n 6 C     Female      202      391   593    0.341 \n 7 D     Male        138      279   417    0.331 \n 8 D     Female      131      244   375    0.349 \n 9 E     Male         53      138   191    0.277 \n10 E     Female       94      299   393    0.239 \n11 F     Male         22      351   373    0.0590\n12 F     Female       24      317   341    0.0704\n\n\n\n\nOne of the following statements best describes the core difference between dept_admit and overall_admit. Pick the most appropriate:\n\n overall_admit counts admissions and rejections by sex; dept_admit further breaks this down by sex overall_admit gives us aggregate trends while dept_admit provides more disaggregated insights dept_admit fails to account for admission status while overall_admit does\n\n\n\nNow the story flips: in most departments, women have higher admission rates than men. So how can the overall numbers suggest the opposite? This reversal is a textbook example of Simpson’s Paradox - a phenomenon where a trend appears in different groups but reverses when the groups are combined.\nIn this case, women were more likely to apply to departments with lower overall admission rates (e.g., departments C, D, E, F), while men applied more to departments with higher admission rates (departments A and B). The aggregate numbers hide this because they mix different denominators across departments.\nThis illustrates a broader lesson: data summaries without disaggregation can obscure the underlying structure of your data. And without visualization, this kind of paradox is hard to detect.\nLet’s visualize the department-level admission rates by gender.\n\nggplot(dept_admit, aes(x = Dept, \n                       y = AdmitRate, \n                       fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Admission Rates by Gender and Department (UC Berkeley, 1973)\",\n       y = \"Admission Rate\", \n       x = \"Department\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male\" = \"#377eb8\", \n                               \"Female\" = \"#e41a1c\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following charts best describes the chart displayed above? histogrampie chartbar chartscatterplotstem-and-leaf diagram\nWhat do the letters x and y refer to, in statistical terms?\n\n X refers to an independent variable; Y refers to a dependent variable X refers to an dependent variable; Y refers to a independent variable X refers to an endogenous variable; Y refers to a exogenous variable X refers to the variable which determines the value of Y Y refers to the variable which determines the value of X\n\nWhich of the following might best describe why we have put AdmitRate as the Y variable in this chart?\n\n Because admission rates determine which department an applicant chooses Because we want to compare how likely applicants are to be admitted across departments and genders Because AdmitRate is a control variable in the admissions process Because AdmitRate belongs on the Y-axis for statistical validity\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that in nearly all departments, women had similar or higher admission rates than men. The illusion of bias in the aggregate comes from differences in application patterns, not unfair decisions within departments. To confirm this, let’s also show how department choice varied by gender.\n\napplicants &lt;- ucb_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(Dept, Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Applicants = sum(Freq))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Dept'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\nggplot(applicants, aes(x = Dept, \n                       y = Applicants, \n                       fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"...\",\n       y = \"...\", \n       x = \"Department\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male\" = \"#377eb8\", \n                               \"Female\" = \"#e41a1c\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second chart reveals that men were more likely to apply to departments A and B, which had higher acceptance rates, while women applied more often to departments C through F, where competition was steeper.\n\n\nWhat is the core difference between the two charts presented above?\n\n The first displays raw admission counts, while the second displays admission rates The first displays admission rates, while the second displays raw admission counts the first chart is inappropriate and brings no added value to the analysis, while the second chart is highly valuable the second chart is inappropriate and brings no added value to the analysis, while the first chart is highly valuable there is no core difference between the two charts; this is a trick question\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Up\nThis example is more than a historical curiosity—it’s a powerful reminder of what can go wrong when we skip visual exploration. Without breaking down the data into meaningful subgroups or visualizing it, we risk drawing misleading conclusions from aggregated numbers—a mistake that can easily obscure important patterns or biases hidden within the data. Here are a few key takeaways:\n\nNever Rely on Aggregates Alone Always ask: What groups might I be collapsing? Can different subgroups tell different stories?\nUse the Right Visualization for the Question Tables are great for precision, but bar plots, dot plots, and faceted graphics help reveal structure. In this case, side-by-side bar charts made the paradox visible in seconds.\nVisuals Help You Understand Your Own Data Good graphics aren’t just for presentations. They’re how you, as a researcher or analyst, come to understand the texture of the data you’re working with.\nTabulation Has Added Value When It Reveals Structure A well-designed cross-tab or grouped summary tells you what’s driving a result. Don’t just count things—count them strategically.\n\n\n\nHungry For More?\nFor more information on the exact data used in this post, check out the full paper here.

    "title": "Thinking Statistically: A Primer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistics As A Way Of Seeing\nEvery social and spatial scientist works with two worlds at once. There is the world we can see; that is, the concrete stuff of daily life: housing prices, bus schedules, job changes, school applications. Then there is the world we infer: the processes we believe are shaping all that surface activity: inequality, migration, gentrification, opportunity, discrimination, efficiency.\nStatistics sits right at that intersection. It is not just a set of techniques for crunching numbers. It is a disciplined way of making sense of experience, especially in messy, complex social settings.\nBut if you’ve ever opened a statistics textbook and felt like it was solving problems you don’t have, or skipping the ones you care about, you’re not alone. Too often, stats is introduced through dry definitions and unfamiliar jargon, rather than through the questions that drive social inquiry.\nSo this first post is not about p-values or confidence intervals. It is about what it means to reason statistically; to adopt a particular way of seeing the world that is especially suited to the challenges of the social and spatial sciences: uncertainty, complexity, partial knowledge, and competing explanations.\n\n\nStatistics Is About Asking [Better] Questions\nThe kind of thinking involved in Statistics may seem quite different from what you are used to. But once we strip away all the jargon and really examine what it is precisely we are doing, you will quickly realise that the kind of thinking involved in statistics is not entirely new to you. In fact, many of your day-to-day assumptions and decisions already depend on statistical thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSuppose I tell you that I have two friends: one is around six feet tall and the other is five feet tall. What would be your best guess as to each one’s sex?\nOf course, you have not seen all men, or all women, but experience probably tells you that by-and-large, men tend to be taller than women.\nTherefore, I expect that you feel fairly confident in assuming that my smaller friend is female, while my taller friend is male. In other words, in the absence of any other information, you probably think it’s more likely that a tall adult is male and a small adult is female.\n\n\nWe do this all the time. When you say: “On average, I cycle 50km per week”, or “We can expect a lot of rain at this time of year”, or “It is more likely that you will do well in your exams if you begin studying early” you are making statistical statements even though you have performed no calculations. Indeed, each of these examples is showing off one particular type of statistical thinking; answer the questions below to figure out which.\n\nWhat type of statistical thinking best corresponds to each of the following scenarios:\n\nOn average, I cycle 50km per week. GeneralizingPredictingSummarizingAssessing\nWe can expect a lot of rain at this time of year. GeneralizingPredictingAssessingSummarizing\nIt is more likely that you will do well in your exams if you begin studying early. AssessingPredictingGeneralizingSummarizing\n\n\nWhen we summarize our past experience in a rough-and-ready way, or generalize from previous experiences, and use this information to make predictions about what we expect, we are subconsciously making broader sense of our lived experiences. That is why thinking statistically is not about chasing certainty, it is about navigating ambiguity with discipline. We use data to challenge our assumptions, to explore patterns we might not otherwise see, and to resist being misled by what seems obvious.\n\n\nBecoming The Right Kind of Skeptic\nWhen people think about statistics, they often think about numbers. Because they are numbers, people thus tend to think that statistics are cold, hard facts that have been bestowed upon us by nature. But statistics are human-made. People choose what to count, how to count it, and how to frame the result. That means statistics are not just facts, they are interpretations.\nTo think statistically, then, is to think critically. It is about learning to ask: Is that plausible? Compared to what? How do they know that? These habits of mind matter, especially in a world full of misleading headlines and dodgy comparisons.\nThe more you practice statistics as a mindset, the more these habits become second nature; a kind of internal skepticism paired with external curiosity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nToday, information is available nearly instantaneously, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell what is true and what is not. Even though misinformation has been a problem that has existed since ancient Greece, the unique problem we face today is that it has proliferated and is closely intertwined on the internet with real information, making it sometimes difficult to identify.\nSome of you who might respond by saying “it is not my job to evaluate statistics critically”. I say that it may not be your job, but it is your responsibility to own your opinions. Taking ownership of these opinions requires you to think critically about the words and numbers you encounter, and scrutinize/examine them as best you can.\n\n\nTest your intuition using the following examples, where TRUE = Plausible and False = Not Plausible:\n\n\nA crystal wine glass fell off a table onto a thick carpet without breaking. TRUEFALSE\nA crystal wine glass fell off the roof of a forty-storey skyscraper onto the footpath without breaking. TRUEFALSE\nThe best salesperson in Company X makes 1,000 sales every day. TRUEFALSE\nThe cost of a telephone has decreased by 12,000% since the formation of the Communication Satellite Corportation. TRUEFALSE\n\n\nProblems 4 and 5 were hopefully easy for most of you. Problem 6 is a bit trickier because it is not immediately obvious where to begin. Assuming that it takes: i) five seconds to dial a phone number, ii) another five seconds for the phone to ring, iii) 10 seconds to deliver your sales pitch, and iv) 40 seconds to collect the buyers bank details and address. That adds up to one call per minute. Finally, lets assume that every phone call ends in a sale. Even under these highly optimistic conditions, you come out sixty sales per hour, and 480 sales in an eight hour work day with no breaks. Need I say any more?\nClaim 7 is difficult to verify if you do not spot the immediate contradiction. If a cost decreases by 100 percent it means that, irrespective of the starting price, the price is now zero. If a cost decreases by 200 percent, it means that someone is paying you the same amount of money that you used to pay them for their product. Thus, while a decrease in price of 100% is quite rare, a decrease of 12000% seems wildly unlikely. You might think this is obvious. Tell that to the editors of Science (a leading scientific journal) who published such a statement.\nThe fact that claim 7 is expressed as a percentage introduces further complexity. Percentages seem so simple and incorruptable, but they are often confusing. For example, if your salary drops by 50% tomorrow, you will not “break-even” by increasing your new salary by 50% because the baselines have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you were recieving €1,000 each week and that suddenly dropped to €500 (a 50% reduction), a 50% increase on that pay only brings you to €750.\n\n\nSimilarly, if interest rates rise from 3 to 4 percent, that constitutes an increase of one percentage point, or an increase of 33 percent. Meanwhile, if interest rates drop from 4 to 3 percent, that constitutes a decrease of one percentage point, but a decrease of 25 percent. Has your head exploded yet?\n\n\nWork A Bit Harder At Thinking Critically\nIn another somewhat famous case, the state of New Jersey adopted legislation that denied additional benefits to mothers who have children while already on welfare. Some legislators believed that women were having babies in New Jersey simply to increase the amount on their welfare checks. Within two months, legislators were declaring that the “family cap” law was a success because births had already fallen by 16 percent, as reported in the New York Times. Now, maybe things are different in New Jersey, but I believe that it takes nine months for a pregnancy to come to term, so how can this effect possibly be attributed to the policy?\nOther claims, like More people have cell phones than toilets (reported by Time Magazine in 2013) are a bit trickier because the answer depends on a host of factors, like who/how we count and what we compare. One potentially reasonable place to start might be the observation that many people in the developing world do not have indoor plumbing, whereas many people in the developed world have more than one cell phone. From this angle, the claim seems plausible. This is not to say that we should accept it, but rather that we cannot reject it out-of-hand as being ridiculous. In this case, what matters isn’t whether you instantly know the answer, but whether you know how to start thinking about it.\nSometimes you cannot always determine whether a statistic or claim is reliable. Sure, the people who generate and report on such statistics should do this for you, but they often do not. Sometimes, this is deliberate (i.e., politically-motivated) but other times the people generating/reporting on these statistics do not understand them all that well. That is how runaway statistics take hold, potentially poisoning public opinion and discourse on a particular topic.\nTake the widely reported statistic (from some years ago) that, in the U.S. 150,000 girls and young women die of annorexia each year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the annual number of deaths from all causes for girls and women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four (a reasonable definition for “girls and young women”?) is around 8,500. If you become more conservative in your definitions and incorporate women aged twnety-five to fourty-four, you still only get 55,000. It should be obvious that annorexia deaths in one year cannot be three times the number of all reported deaths.\nStatistical thinking begins not with formulas, but with noticing. Noticing change. Noticing contrast. Noticing when something feels off. You do not need advanced math to do this. You need curiosity, a willingness to slow down, and a readiness to challenge your first impression.\n\n\nWrapping Up\nStatistics is not just about techniques. It is about developing better instincts and organising your curiosity. It helps you ask clearer questions and give more careful answers.\nIt will not turn you into a calculator. But it will help you see more clearly. To doubt usefully, not cynically. To ask things like: Where did that number come from? What is the comparison? What is the alternative?\nIf you have ever had a hunch something was not quite right, or spotted a pattern in your surroundings, congratulations. You have already started thinking statistically.\n\n\nBibliography\n\nStatistics Without Tears: An Introduction For Non-Mathematicians, by Derek Rowntree\nA Field Guide To Lies and Statistics: A Neuroscientist on How to Make Sense of A Complex World, by Daniel J.
