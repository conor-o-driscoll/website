It focuses on understanding the causes of regional socio-economic inequalities and explores how governments and other actors attempt to address them through policy at different spatial scales.\nThe course has two main aims. First, it introduces students to key theoretical and empirical debates in Economic Geography. Second, it applies these insights to real-world practices in local and regional development. Topics include regional labour markets, entrepreneurship, globalization, and spatial policy tools such as city branding, business incentives, and land-use planning.\nStudents explore both analytical concepts and empirical approaches, with a focus on the interaction between people, firms, policy, and place. The course highlights the role of institutions and governance structures in shaping regional outcomes, and discusses how development paths differ across city regions, intermediate areas, and rural zones.\nA key feature of the course is its applied orientation. Students learn how academic insights relate to practical policy decisions, preparing them for careers in regional development. This includes a study trip to Brussels to engage with institutions involved in EU regional policy.\nBy the end of the course, students are able to analyse complex geographical patterns, understand the relationship between economic and spatial processes, and assess policy responses to regional challenges.

The content relates to undergraduate statistics and econometrics, and was taught to students studying economics, finance, and commerce. Relevant materials can be made available upon request.\n\nIntroductory Statistics\nThese courses start with introductions to descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and probability. Much of this learning focuses on how these subjects relate to business practices. Students are introduced to elementary calculus, the mathematics of finance, differentiation, matrix algebra, alongside exponential, logarithmic, and polynomial functions. Students use this knowledge to calculate elasticities, solve for equilibria, and work with series and annuities.\nFrom there, a major emphasis is placed on the practical application of statistics to business contexts. Teaching centres around the practicalities of working with data. Students are exposed to key software used for analysing economic and financial data, such as Excel and STATA. They are also tasked with collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting economic data in written reports. Supplementing this are introductions to the numerous types of economic and financial data available, and the outlets from which these data can be acquired.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1111 (Economic Data Collection) EC1200 (Quantitative Techniques For Economics 1) EC1209 (Understanding and Interpreting Data) MA1100 (Introductory Mathematics For Business)\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.

Elementary Statistics For Geographers by James Burt, Gerald Barber, and David Rigby\n\n\nIntermediate Statistics and Econometrics\nThese courses build upon foundational statistics and probability knowledge by equipping students with the skills to critically evaluate economic research, data, methods, and findings. This is supplemented by introductions to hypothesis testing and statistical inference using cross-sectional and time-series methods.\nFrom there, students are exposed to the relationships between economic theory and practice, and how different modelling techniques can be applied to different scenarios within a business context. In particular, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, functional forms, and variable transformations are introduced while assessment emphasizes the interpretation of findings and implications of using different empirical techniques.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1210 (Skills For Analysing Economic Data) EC2015 (Research in Economics) EC2116 (Introduction To Statistical Economic Analysis) EC2206 (Business Econometrics and Forecasting) EC4215 (Business Econometrics 1) Excel and STATA material\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.

Topics covered include:\n\nDescriptive Statistics and Data Visualisation (STATA, Excel, and R)\nMoving Averages and Forecasting (Excel)\nSimple and Multiple Linear Regression (STATA and R)\nVariable Transformations and Functional Forms (STATA and R)\nBinary, Multinomial, and Ordinal Logistic Regression (R)\n\n\n\n\nMacroeconomics\nThis covers a series of courses I taught at University College Cork. The content relates to undergraduate macroeconomics, and was taught to students studying economics, finance, and commerce. Relevant materials can be made available upon request.\n\nIntroductory Macroeconomics\nThese courses start with the study of the economy as a whole, focusing on aggregate measures such as national income, unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Students learn to work with theories of supply and demand, fiscal and monetary policy, international trade, and exchange rates, while also covering national income accounting, the measurement of economic activity, and the circular flow of income.\nThe role of government in influencing economic outcomes is also explored. Topics such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, and the role of central banks are discussed, along with the challenges and trade-offs involved in implementing macroeconomic policies. This provides students with opportunities to apply theoretical concepts to analyze current economic events and policy debates, enhancing their critical thinking and analytical skills.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1116 (Introductory Macroeconomics) EC1208 (Principles of the Macro Economy) EC1503 (Economic Analysis for Food Business) EC1122 (Markets, Governments and the Economics of Social Issues)\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.

Robinson\n\n\nIntermediate Macroeconomics\nThese courses build upon the work done in introductory modules by focusing on specific themes and issues within macroeconomics. Themes and topics studied include human capital, inequality, money and monetary policy, alongside national and international economic variables which affect business performance.\nSome of these courses then pivot to focus on social issues and policy, thereby requiring detailed analysis of issues like healthcare, pensions, and the welfare state, while some of these courses focus on financial markets. An overarching theme in these courses, however, is the role of governmental intervention in the economy alongside how Ireland is situated in the global macroeconomic environment. This provides students with opportunities to apply theoretical concepts to analyze current economic events and policy debates, enhancing their critical thinking and analytical skills.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC2010 (The Changing Economy: Money and Monetary Policy) EC2112 (Macroeconomics: Irish and International Business Cycles) EC2151 (Economics of Social Policy 1) EC2220 (Microeconomics and Macroeconomic Outcomes) EC2214 (The Macroeconomic Environment in a Global Context) EC3151 (Economics of Social Policy 2)\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.

The content relates to undergraduate microeconomics, and was taught to students studying economics, finance, and commerce. Relevant materials can be made available upon request.\n\nIntroductory Microeconomics\nThese courses start by introducing fundamental economic principles at the individual level, focusing on supply, demand, market equilibrium, opportunity costs, and elasticity. The material then evolves to emphasize consumer and producer behaviour under different conditions and within different market contexts.\nThese courses then pivot to consider the role of firms and governments in the microeconomic environment. Of particular interest here is the efficient allocation of resources and leads students to a more nuanced understanding of how policies such as taxation, subsidies, and regulations affect market outcomes.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1117 (Markets and Governments: An Introduction to Economics) EC1213 (Microeconomic Reasoning and Practice) EC1202 (Economic Reasoning For Business) EC1212 (Economics of Business 1) EC1500 (Ethics and Economic Decision Making in Food Business)\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.

Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains The World, by Ha-Joon Chang.\n\n\nIntermediate Microeconomics\nThese courses build upon introductory material by focusing on the interactions between producers and consumers within different types of markets. In particular, entrepreneurship, the competitive process and technological change, the determination of the relative prices of goods, and factors of production under various types of market structure are all covered.\nThese courses then pivot in three distinct directions to focus on the government, the firm, and labour market. We consider the role of government in achieving social goals and public policy objectives. Students examine how government actions impact resource allocation, income distribution, and overall welfare. For the firm, we focus on budgets, risk and uncertainty, revenue functions, alongside production and cost analysis. While in labour markets, we emphasize the factors driving labour supply and demand, the acquisition of training and skills, technology and decision making, alongside government intervention in such markets, such as through minimum wages and taxation.\nIn University College Cork, I have been involved in the following courses which fit this description in different capacities:\nEC1121 (Markets, Governments, and The Economics of Social Issues) EC2200 (Economics of Managerial Decision Making) EC3127 (Economics of The Labour Market) EC4211 (Economics of The Labour Market)\nBooks Which I Like (And Sometimes Recommend) On These (and Adjacent) Topics 1.
